1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had
more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to
explain what you would add.

Ans: I spent 7 hours to design the App. Given the time, first thing I would love to do is writing test cases and then adding more features like pagination, locating on the map etc followed by refactoring and beautification.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

Ans: React 16.x is out and it comes packed with some useful new features that are very much worth getting excited about. It's a minor release with major features focused on performance optimization. The main new features include:
	a. React.memo()
	b. React.lazy()
	c. static contextType()
	d. static getDerivedStateFromError()
	e. a number of deprecations in StrictMode
	
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Ans: Yes, I have done. First thing to note is talk to the respective person / team and get the steps to replicate the issue. If we can replicate in our local environment thats great. If not, we need to try simulate with the same data as that of production by masking sensitive information.

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

Ans: its missing timings of restaurant, payment options, dress code, facilities and parking details.
